## Open Source Software

I have spent a lot of time contributing to Open Source Software.
This type of software is valuable because it democratises access to computational tools
and encourages reproducible science. Also, anybody is welcome to help make it better.

See below for some [Articles](#articles) written about my Open Source work.

## Career Interests

I am open to opportunities in the fields of Computer Science and Software Engineering,
as well as their intersections with Philosophy, Politics, and Music.

I am particularly interested in opportunities to apply my skills to
empower workers and grassroots community organisations in the face of corporate hell.

## Other Interests

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to [Open Source Software](#open-source-software),
listening to [music](../music/), running, playing football and pool, and video games.

I am broadly interested in politics, particularly in politics which aims to
reduce inequality, increase democracy, and foster peace.
